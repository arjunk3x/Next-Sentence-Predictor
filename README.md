# Next-Sentence-Predictor

This project implements a next sentence predictor using LSTMs, achieving an accuracy of approximately 95%. It employs techniques such as tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, and word embeddings to enhance training efficiency and prediction accuracy.

*Overview:*

The Next Sentence Predictor project aims to predict the next sentence in a sequence using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. This task is crucial in various natural language processing applications, including language modeling and text generation. The project utilizes techniques such as tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, and word embeddings to preprocess the input data and trains a deep learning model to make accurate predictions.

*Technologies Used:*

1) TensorFlow

2) Keras

3) Pandas

4) NumPy

5) NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

6) Gensim

7) Scikit-learn

***Key Features:***

*LSTM Model:* The project utilizes LSTM networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), for sequence prediction tasks. LSTMs are well-suited for capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data, making them ideal for next sentence prediction.

*Preprocessing Techniques:* Various preprocessing techniques such as tokenization (using NLTK's RegexpTokenizer), TF-IDF vectorization (using Scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer), and word embeddings (using Gensim's Word2Vec) are employed to prepare the input data for model training.

*Bidirectional LSTM:* The model architecture includes Bidirectional LSTMs, which process the input sequence both forwards and backwards, enhancing the understanding of context and improving prediction accuracy.

*Optimization Techniques:* Techniques such as padding sequences (using Keras' pad_sequences) and converting labels to categorical format (using Keras' to_categorical) are applied to optimize model training and improve performance.

*Achieved Accuracy:* The project achieves an accuracy of around 95%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the chosen model architecture and preprocessing techniques in accurately predicting the next sentence.
